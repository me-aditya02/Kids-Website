      <p> In the Spring of 1847, the little village of Ruralville was thrown into a state of 
        excitement by the landing of a strange Brig in the harbour. It carried no flag, and no name 
        was painted on its side, and everything about it was such as would excite suspicion. It was 
        from Tripoli, Africa, and the captain was named Manuel Ruello. The Excitement increased, 
        however; when John Griggs, (The magnate of the villiage) suddenly disappeared from his 
        home. This was the night of October 4th—on October 5th the Brig left.</p> 
        <p> It was 8 bells on the U.S. Frigate “Constitution” when Commander Farragut sighted a 
            strange brig to the westward. It carried no flag, and no name was painted on its side, and 
            everything about it was such as would excite suspicion. On hailing it put up the Pirates 
            Flag. Farragut ordered a gun fired and no sooner did he fire, than the pirate ship gave them 
            a broadside when the Fight was over Commander Farragut Missed one man named Henry 
            F. Johns</p>

            cried “Companions! I sight a ship! with no flag and with no name printed on the side and 
            with everything about it such as would excite Suspicion!” And The Natives fled in all 
            directions when They came together on The other side of The Island one was missing his 
            name was Dahabea.</p>
            <p>At length it was Decided Something must be done, Notes were compared. Three

                Dahabea, were recalled. Finally Advertisements were issued offering £5000 reward for the
